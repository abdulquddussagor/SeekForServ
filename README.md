# SeekForServ: A Novel Hybrid Service Model for Empowering Smart Societies.


# Project Outcome:
 A hybrid freelancing system that is specifically tailored for Bangladesh is the goal of the
 project. This innovative platform will combine the advantages of online freelancing with
 localized services, connecting freelancers and clients within the country. The system will
 have a simple interface that will let freelancers highlight their abilities and clients use
 smart filtering tools to find potential freelancers. A rating and review system will also
 encourage openness and reliability. The platform will place a high priority on encouraging
 local firms and entrepreneurs to build the local economy. The project’s ultimate goal is
 to provide a vibrant and inclusive freelance marketplace that empowers independent contractors, 
 enables effective talent procurement for enterprises, and supports the expansion
 of Bangladesh’s freelance market.

## Detailed Methodology and Design:

 The primary goal of building our service platform SeekForServ is to cater to the Bangladeshi
 audience and assist them in providing or seeking service from a specific website. The De
 sign and workflow of the website are described below:

 At first, Any user can log in to our website in two possible ways. Either the service
 provider or the service receiver. Both have to do the authentication test first. If any user
 logs in through a service provider, he/she will have to go through another verification
 process. If he is a new user he has to do the registration first and the registration process
 will be verified by the admin. The user may get a notification if he is not verified by the
 admin. If it’s an old user then he/she can enlist new categories in the database. The new
 services will be available on our website for other users as well. If a user logs in to take
 service, they will be able to see the list of services available on the
 website already updated by the service providers. Service seekers can search by nearby
 location and seek their desired services. The service provider will get a notification from
 the customer and finalize the deal. Now, if the customer doesn’t get his desired service, he
 can also send a request to the admin. Now coming to the payment system, the customer
 can do online/offline payments and give a short review about the service. The service
 provider must ensure the admin that the task is done.
