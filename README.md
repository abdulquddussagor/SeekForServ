 The phrase ”freelancing” is most frequently used in the cultural and creative sectors.
 Stating the objectives of a hybrid freelancing system, such as improving accessibility,
 bridging the digital divide, and enhancing opportunities for freelancers in Bangladesh.
 The proposed website “SeekForServ” serves as a hybrid service system, providing both
 physical and online services by connecting customers with local service providers. It acts
 as a conduit, facilitating the discovery of location-based services through the platform.
 The website aims to benefit both service providers and customers by connecting them. As
 a result, this platform will provide opportunities to individuals who have a small budget,
 to begin with, or who wish to work as an entrepreneur.

## Project Outcome:
 A hybrid freelancing system that is specifically tailored for Bangladesh is the goal of the
 project. This innovative platform will combine the advantages of online freelancing with
 localized services, connecting freelancers and clients within the country. The system will
 have a simple interface that will let freelancers highlight their abilities and clients use
 smart filtering tools to find potential freelancers. A rating and review system will also
 encourage openness and reliability. The platform will place a high priority on encouraging
 local firms and entrepreneurs to build the local economy. The project’s ultimate goal is
 to provide a vibrant and inclusive freelance marketplace that empowers independent con
tractors, enables effective talent procurement for enterprises, and supports the expansion
 of Bangladesh’s freelance market.
